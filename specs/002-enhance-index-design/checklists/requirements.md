# Requirements Checklist - Enhanced Index Page Design

**Feature**: 002-enhance-index-design
**Generated**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

---

## Content Quality

### ✅ No Implementation Details
- [x] Spec describes WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- [x] No specific technology choices (CSS frameworks, libraries) mandated
- [x] No code snippets or implementation approaches
- [x] Focus on user-facing outcomes and requirements

**Validation**: Spec focuses on visual outcomes (color coding, badges, typography) without prescribing implementation methods.

### ✅ User-Focused Language
- [x] User stories written from visitor perspective
- [x] Requirements describe user-visible behavior
- [x] Success criteria measure user experience outcomes
- [x] No internal system terminology exposed to users

**Validation**: All 4 user stories start with "As a visitor, I want..." and describe observable benefits.

### ✅ No Premature Decisions
- [x] Technology choices deferred to planning phase
- [x] Visual design specifics (exact colors, fonts) not locked in
- [x] Implementation approach left flexible
- [x] Room for designer/developer judgment

**Validation**: Requirements specify categories and metadata without dictating exact visual treatment.

## Requirement Completeness

### ✅ All Requirements Testable
- [x] FR-001: Visual category indicators → Can verify each project has distinct visual markers
- [x] FR-002: Technology tags → Can verify tags are displayed for each project
- [x] FR-003: Status badges → Can verify status indicators are present
- [x] FR-004: Key features display → Can count feature highlights (2-3 per project)
- [x] FR-005: Responsive design → Can test across screen sizes
- [x] FR-006: Typography hierarchy → Can verify heading levels and styling
- [x] FR-007: Color scheme → Can evaluate color harmony and consistency
- [x] FR-008: Interactive states → Can test hover/focus transitions
- [x] FR-009: Project icons → Can verify each project has visual identifier
- [x] FR-010: Accessibility → Can run WCAG 2.1 AA automated and manual tests
- [x] FR-011: Maintainability → Can measure time to add new styled project

**Validation**: Each requirement has clear acceptance criteria defined in user stories.

### ✅ Requirements Are Measurable
- [x] SC-001: 2-second recognition time (measurable via user testing)
- [x] SC-002: 90% positive feedback (quantifiable survey result)
- [x] SC-003: 30% faster project finding (measurable time reduction)
- [x] SC-004: 8/10 aesthetic quality score (numeric rating)
- [x] SC-005: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (pass/fail)
- [x] SC-006: <3 second page load (measurable performance)
- [x] SC-007: <10 minute setup time (measurable duration)
- [x] SC-008: 320px-1920px+ compatibility (testable range)

**Validation**: All 8 success criteria include specific metrics or thresholds.

### ✅ No Unanswered Clarifications
- [x] Edge cases documented (6 scenarios identified)
- [x] Project scope clearly defined (visual enhancement, not functionality change)
- [x] Technology constraints established (CSS-only enhancements preferred)
- [x] Icon strategy outlined (emoji/SVG to avoid image files)
- [x] Metadata source clarified (manual curation)

**Validation**: Assumptions section addresses data sources, technical approach, and scope boundaries.

## Feature Readiness

### ✅ User Stories Have Acceptance Criteria
- [x] User Story 1: 3 acceptance scenarios defined (visual differentiation, category styling, quick identification)
- [x] User Story 2: 4 acceptance scenarios defined (tech tags, status badges, features, organization)
- [x] User Story 3: 4 acceptance scenarios defined (spacing, typography, colors, interactions)
- [x] User Story 4: 3 acceptance scenarios defined (unique icons, recognition, appropriate representation)

**Validation**: Total of 14 acceptance scenarios across 4 user stories using Given-When-Then format.

### ✅ Success Criteria Defined
- [x] 8 quantifiable success criteria spanning:
  - User performance (recognition speed, finding efficiency)
  - User satisfaction (90% positive feedback)
  - Technical quality (accessibility, performance, responsiveness)
  - Maintainability (setup time for new projects)
  - Visual quality (aesthetic score)

**Validation**: Success criteria cover functional, non-functional, and qualitative aspects.

### ✅ Priorities Assigned
- [x] P1: Visual Project Differentiation (critical for core value)
- [x] P1: Enhanced Project Information Display (critical for informativeness)
- [x] P2: Improved Visual Hierarchy (important for polish)
- [x] P3: Project Thumbnails/Icons (nice-to-have enhancement)

**Validation**: Priorities follow constitutional principle of incremental delivery with clear P1 MVP focus.

## Additional Quality Checks

### ✅ Constitutional Alignment
- [x] Quality-First: Focus on visual polish and professional appearance
- [x] Simplicity: CSS-only enhancements, no framework dependencies
- [x] Pragmatic Testing: Visual validation, accessibility testing, user feedback
- [x] Incremental Delivery: Clear P1/P2/P3 priorities enabling phased rollout
- [x] Balanced Approach: Spec-driven design without over-specification

**Validation**: Feature design respects all 5 constitutional principles.

### ✅ Key Entities Enhanced
- [x] Project entity extended with 7 new attributes:
  - Category (required): Enables visual differentiation
  - Technologies (optional): Provides tech stack visibility
  - Status (optional): Shows project lifecycle stage
  - Features (optional): Highlights key capabilities
  - Icon (optional): Visual identifier
  - Color Theme (optional): Accent color customization
  - All attributes optional except Category to maintain simplicity

**Validation**: Entity enhancements support all functional requirements without excessive complexity.

### ✅ Edge Cases Documented
- [x] Missing metadata handling (projects without tags)
- [x] Content length variations (short/long descriptions)
- [x] Extreme screen sizes (<320px)
- [x] Inactive/archived projects differentiation
- [x] Many technology tags (10+)
- [x] Non-English character support

**Validation**: 6 edge cases identified covering data, display, and internationalization concerns.

## Final Assessment

**Overall Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

**Strengths**:
1. Clear user-focused outcomes with measurable success criteria
2. Comprehensive functional requirements (11 FRs) covering all user stories
3. Well-defined priorities enabling incremental delivery
4. Constitutional alignment with simplicity and quality principles
5. Thorough edge case documentation
6. Enhanced data model supports requirements without bloat

**No Issues Found**: Specification meets all quality standards and is ready to proceed to the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation planning to determine technical approach, design system, and task breakdown.

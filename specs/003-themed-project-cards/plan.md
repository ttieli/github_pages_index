# Implementation Plan: Themed Project Cards with Chinese Descriptions

**Branch**: `003-themed-project-cards` | **Date**: 2025-10-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-themed-project-cards/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Add Chinese language support and theme-specific visual styling to project index cards. Each of the 4 existing project cards will receive custom CSS themes that reflect their content: Matrix/hacker style (SpecKit-Manager), family-friendly budgeting (Allowance Manager), Nintendo game aesthetic (Vocabulary Cards), and professional utility styling (Scan). All content will be available in simplified Chinese. Implementation uses CSS-only approach maintaining existing HTML5 structure from feature 002.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3 (no specific version - browser-native)
**Primary Dependencies**: None (pure HTML/CSS, zero external dependencies)
**Storage**: N/A (static HTML/CSS files served via GitHub Pages)
**Testing**: Manual visual validation, browser DevTools accessibility audit, responsive design testing
**Target Platform**: GitHub Pages (static site hosting), all major browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
**Project Type**: Static web page (single HTML file + CSS stylesheet)
**Performance Goals**: Page load < 3 seconds, First Contentful Paint < 1.5 seconds, CSS size increase < 5KB
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance (4.5:1 contrast), responsive 320px-1920px+, UTF-8 encoding for Chinese characters
**Scale/Scope**: 4 project cards, 1 site header, ~5KB additional CSS for themes, simplified Chinese text content

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Quality-First Development

- ✅ **PASS**: Feature prioritizes accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), performance (< 5KB CSS), and UTF-8 correctness
- ✅ **PASS**: All functional requirements defined before implementation (FR-001 through FR-011)
- ✅ **PASS**: No technical debt introduced - CSS-only approach maintains existing structure

### Principle II: Test-Driven & Specification-Driven Balance

- ✅ **PASS**: SDD approach appropriate for visual/styling work - specification defines desired outcomes first
- ✅ **PASS**: All user stories have clear acceptance criteria (5 stories with Given/When/Then scenarios)
- ✅ **PASS**: Manual testing strategy defined (visual validation, accessibility audit, responsive testing)
- ⚠️  **NOTE**: TDD not applicable - CSS styling doesn't have unit-testable business logic

### Principle III: Simplicity Over Complexity

- ✅ **PASS**: CSS-only implementation - no JavaScript, no build tools, no dependencies
- ✅ **PASS**: Extends existing HTML structure from feature 002 rather than rebuilding
- ✅ **PASS**: Themes implemented via CSS selectors and custom properties (simple, maintainable)
- ✅ **PASS**: No frameworks or libraries introduced

### Principle IV: Pragmatic Testing Strategy

- ✅ **PASS**: Testing focused on risk areas (accessibility, responsive design, cross-browser compatibility)
- ✅ **PASS**: Manual testing appropriate for visual quality and theme consistency
- ✅ **PASS**: No unit tests needed for CSS styling (would provide minimal value)
- ✅ **PASS**: Integration testing via browser DevTools (accessibility audit, responsive emulation)

### Principle V: Incremental Delivery

- ✅ **PASS**: Feature broken into 5 independently testable user stories (P1, P2, P2, P2, P3)
- ✅ **PASS**: P1 (Chinese language support) can be delivered independently as MVP
- ✅ **PASS**: Each theme (P2 stories) can be implemented and deployed independently
- ✅ **PASS**: P3 (Scan utility theme) can be deferred if needed

**Overall Status**: ✅ **ALL GATES PASSED** - No constitutional violations. Proceed to Phase 0.

**Structure Decision**: Static website structure - no src/ or tests/ directories needed. All modifications will be to existing `index.html` and `css/styles.css` files. This maintains the simple, zero-dependency architecture established in feature 001 and enhanced in feature 002.

## Complexity Tracking

# Specification Quality Checklist: Themed Project Cards with Chinese Descriptions

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - All checklist items validated

### Detailed Assessment

**Content Quality**: All items passed
- Spec focuses on user-facing outcomes (Chinese descriptions, visual themes)
- No mention of specific CSS frameworks, preprocessors, or technical implementation
- Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: All items passed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are unambiguous
- Each functional requirement is testable (can verify Chinese text displays, themes apply correctly, accessibility maintained)
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (2 seconds, 4.5:1 contrast, 5KB size limit, 90% satisfaction, 100% Chinese coverage)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of CSS classes, selectors, or technical architecture)
- All user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases identified (long text, small screens, accessibility modes, print, new projects)
- Scope is clearly bounded to 4 existing projects with specific themes
- Assumptions documented (Chinese language preference, color schemes, theme implementation approach)

**Feature Readiness**: All items passed
- Each functional requirement maps to user story acceptance criteria
- User scenarios cover all primary flows (Chinese language support + 4 theme implementations)
- Success criteria measurable and aligned with functional requirements
- No technical implementation details present in specification

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.implement`.

All requirements are clear, testable, and focused on user value. The specification successfully separates WHAT users need from HOW it will be implemented.

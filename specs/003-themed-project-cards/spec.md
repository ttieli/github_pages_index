## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Chinese Language Support (Priority: P1)

Visitors can view project descriptions in Chinese to better understand each project's purpose and features without language barriers.

**Why this priority**: Chinese language support is foundational - without it, Chinese-speaking users cannot effectively understand the projects. This is the base requirement that enables all other enhancements to be meaningful.

**Independent Test**: Open the index page and verify all project cards display Chinese descriptions alongside or replacing English text. A Chinese-speaking user can understand each project's purpose without needing English.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor opens the index page, **When** they view any project card, **Then** they see Chinese description text that explains the project's purpose
2. **Given** a visitor views the site header, **When** they read the page title and subtitle, **Then** they see Chinese text that welcomes them and describes the site's purpose
3. **Given** a Chinese-speaking user browses the page, **When** they scan all project cards, **Then** they can understand each project without referring to external translation tools

### User Story 2 - SpecKit-Manager Matrix/Hacker Theme (Priority: P2)

Visitors viewing the SpecKit-Manager card see a Matrix-inspired hacker aesthetic that reflects the project's programming and workflow automation nature.

**Why this priority**: This is the first theme implementation and serves as a proof of concept. SpecKit-Manager benefits most from distinctive styling as it's a technical tool for developers.

**Independent Test**: View the SpecKit-Manager project card and verify it has Matrix-style visual elements (green terminal text, digital rain effects, monospace fonts, dark backgrounds) that distinguish it from other cards.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor views the index page, **When** they see the SpecKit-Manager card, **Then** it displays Matrix-inspired visual styling (green color scheme, terminal-like appearance)
2. **Given** a visitor hovers over the SpecKit-Manager card, **When** the card responds to interaction, **Then** the hover effects maintain the hacker/programming theme
3. **Given** a visitor compares project cards, **When** they look at SpecKit-Manager alongside other projects, **Then** the Matrix theme clearly differentiates it as a technical/developer tool

### User Story 3 - Allowance Manager Family-Friendly Theme (Priority: P2)

Visitors viewing the Allowance Manager card see a warm, family-friendly budgeting style that reflects its purpose for managing children's allowances.

**Why this priority**: Equal priority with other themes - this style helps parents immediately recognize the tool's family-oriented purpose and builds trust through appropriate visual design.

**Independent Test**: View the Allowance Manager card and verify it has warm, approachable styling (soft colors, friendly typography, family-oriented visual elements) that conveys trust and simplicity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor views the index page, **When** they see the Allowance Manager card, **Then** it displays family-friendly visual styling (warm colors, approachable design, budget/coin iconography)
2. **Given** a parent looking for family budgeting tools, **When** they scan the project cards, **Then** the Allowance Manager card's styling signals it's appropriate for family/children use
3. **Given** a visitor compares project cards, **When** they look at Allowance Manager, **Then** its warm, trustworthy aesthetic contrasts with the technical SpecKit-Manager theme

### User Story 4 - Vocabulary Cards Nintendo Game Theme (Priority: P2)

Visitors viewing the Vocabulary Cards project see Nintendo-inspired game styling that reflects its gamified English learning approach.

**Why this priority**: Equal priority with other themes - the playful Nintendo aesthetic helps users immediately understand this is a fun, game-based learning tool.

**Independent Test**: View the Vocabulary Cards card and verify it has Nintendo game-inspired styling (bright colors, playful fonts, game UI elements) that evokes classic Nintendo educational games.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor views the index page, **When** they see the Vocabulary Cards card, **Then** it displays Nintendo-inspired visual styling (bright colors, pixelated or rounded fonts, game-like UI elements)
2. **Given** a language learner browsing projects, **When** they see the Vocabulary Cards card, **Then** the playful gaming aesthetic signals this is an interactive, fun learning experience
3. **Given** a visitor familiar with Nintendo aesthetics, **When** they view the Vocabulary Cards card, **Then** they recognize visual cues reminiscent of Nintendo educational games

### User Story 5 - Scan Utility Tool Theme (Priority: P3)

Visitors viewing the Scan project card see professional utility tool styling that reflects its purpose as an internal network QR code scanner.

**Why this priority**: Lower priority as Scan is a beta utility tool with narrower audience. The theme should be clean and functional, emphasizing reliability and technical capability.

**Independent Test**: View the Scan card and verify it has clean, professional utility styling that conveys technical functionality and reliability for internal network use.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor views the index page, **When** they see the Scan card, **Then** it displays professional utility tool styling (clean lines, technical color scheme, scanner/network iconography)
2. **Given** an IT professional or internal user, **When** they view the Scan card, **Then** the styling communicates this is a reliable, no-nonsense technical tool
3. **Given** a visitor compares all cards, **When** they see the Scan card, **Then** its clean, functional aesthetic differentiates it from the more expressive themed cards

### Edge Cases

- What happens when text content is too long for the themed card design? (Ensure text truncation or scrolling maintains theme integrity)
- How do themes render on very small screens (320px mobile)? (Themes should gracefully simplify while maintaining core visual identity)
- What if a user has custom browser fonts or high contrast mode enabled? (Themes should remain recognizable while respecting accessibility settings)
- How do themes look when printed? (Consider providing print-friendly fallback styles)
- What happens if a new project is added without a specific theme? (Default to the existing category-based styling from feature 002)

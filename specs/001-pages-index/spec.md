# Feature Specification: GitHub Pages Project Index

**Feature Branch**: `001-pages-index`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "我有很多github pages做的部署项目页面,我想做一个汇总页,就是把所有项目的index.html都提供一个链接,最终这个汇总项目也是部署到github pages的一个单独项目里,页面中提供一些简要介绍"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View All Projects at a Glance (Priority: P1)

As a visitor, I want to see a list of all available GitHub Pages projects in one place, so I can quickly discover and access the projects that interest me.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the index page - providing a centralized directory. Without this, the feature has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the index page and verifying that all project links are displayed with their descriptions. Delivers immediate value by providing project discovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I navigate to the index page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a list of all available projects with their titles
2. **Given** I see the project list, **When** I look at each project entry, **Then** I see a brief description for each project
3. **Given** I see a project entry, **When** I click on the project link, **Then** I am taken to that project's GitHub Pages site in the same or new tab

### User Story 2 - Navigate to Projects Easily (Priority: P2)

As a visitor, I want the project links to be clearly clickable and organized, so I can efficiently navigate to the project I'm interested in.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability and user experience. The basic list (P1) works, but good navigation improves the quality of interaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by interacting with project links - clicking them, observing visual feedback, and verifying navigation behavior. Delivers enhanced usability on top of basic listing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I hover over a project link, **When** the mouse is over the link, **Then** I see visual feedback (e.g., color change, underline)
2. **Given** I see multiple projects, **When** I scan the list, **Then** projects are visually separated and easy to distinguish
3. **Given** I click a project link, **When** navigation occurs, **Then** the target page opens reliably without errors

---

### User Story 3 - Understand Project Context (Priority: P3)

As a visitor, I want to see additional context about each project (such as category, status, or tags), so I can better understand what each project offers before clicking.

**Why this priority**: Adds discoverability and filtering capability. Nice to have but not essential for the MVP. The basic description (P1) provides minimum context.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing the index page and verifying that contextual information (categories, tags, status) is displayed for each project. Delivers enhanced project discovery on top of basic descriptions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I view the project list, **When** I look at each entry, **Then** I see additional metadata (e.g., project type, status, last updated)
2. **Given** projects have different categories, **When** I view the list, **Then** I can identify the category or type of each project
3. **Given** I want to find specific types of projects, **When** I scan the metadata, **Then** I can quickly identify projects matching my interests

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the list contains no projects (empty state)?
- What happens when a project link is broken or the target page no longer exists?
- What happens when project descriptions are very long or contain special characters?
- How does the page handle a large number of projects (50+, 100+)?
- What happens when a project has no description provided?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a list of all available GitHub Pages projects
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a clickable link for each project that navigates to the project's index page
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a brief description for each project
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle empty states gracefully when no projects are configured
- **FR-005**: System MUST render properly on common screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **FR-006**: System MUST be deployable as a standalone GitHub Pages project
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow easy addition of new projects by editing the HTML file directly (hardcoded approach)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear visual indication that links are clickable
- **FR-009**: Project links MUST open in a functional manner (same tab or new tab)

### Assumptions

- Projects are assumed to be stable URLs that don't change frequently
- All projects have at least a title; descriptions are optional but recommended
- The index page itself will be hosted on GitHub Pages at a dedicated repository
- Updates to the project list will be manual (no automated discovery or API integration)
- All linked projects are publicly accessible
- The index page will be a static HTML page (no server-side processing)

### Key Entities

- **Project**: Represents a single GitHub Pages deployment
  - Title (required): The name of the project
  - URL (required): The full URL to the project's index.html or root page
  - Description (optional): A brief summary of what the project is about
  - Category/Tags (optional, P3): Metadata for organizing or filtering projects
  - Status (optional, P3): Active, archived, experimental, etc.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Visitors can find and access any listed project within 10 seconds of landing on the index page
- **SC-002**: The index page loads completely in under 3 seconds on standard broadband connections
- **SC-003**: All project links are functional and lead to the correct destination pages
- **SC-004**: The page is readable and usable on screens from mobile (320px width) to desktop (1920px+ width)
- **SC-005**: Adding a new project to the index takes less than 5 minutes for someone with basic HTML knowledge
- **SC-006**: 95% of visitors can successfully click through to at least one project on their first visit

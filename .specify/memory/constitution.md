## Core Principles

### I. Quality-First Development

Quality is non-negotiable and takes precedence over speed or feature completeness. Every deliverable MUST meet defined quality standards before being considered complete.

**Rules:**
- Code MUST be readable, maintainable, and well-documented
- All functional requirements MUST be met before deployment
- Technical debt MUST be tracked and addressed systematically
- Performance, security, and reliability are mandatory quality dimensions

**Rationale:** Starting with quality prevents costly rework and ensures long-term project sustainability. Quality cannot be retrofitted—it must be built in from the start.

### II. Test-Driven & Specification-Driven Balance

Development MUST balance TDD (Test-Driven Development) and SDD (Specification-Driven Development) approaches, choosing the most effective method for each context.

**Rules:**
- **For critical business logic**: TDD is mandatory—write tests first, watch them fail, then implement
- **For integration/workflow**: SDD is preferred—define specifications first, then implement with validation
- **For exploratory work**: Specification-first with test coverage added during implementation
- Tests MUST be meaningful and validate actual requirements, not just achieve coverage metrics
- Every user story MUST have clear acceptance criteria before implementation begins

**Rationale:** TDD excels for unit-level correctness; SDD excels for system-level coherence. Using both appropriately maximizes quality while maintaining development velocity.

### III. Simplicity Over Complexity

MUST always choose the simplest solution that meets the requirements. Complexity requires explicit justification and approval.

**Rules:**
- Apply YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)—implement only what is needed now
- Reject premature abstraction—wait for 3 use cases before generalizing
- Avoid framework/library additions unless existing tools are demonstrably insufficient
- Document and justify any complexity introduced (see Complexity Tracking in plan template)
- Refactor toward simplicity when complexity is discovered during implementation

**Rationale:** Over-engineering creates maintenance burden, increases cognitive load, and slows development. Start simple and evolve complexity only when proven necessary.

### IV. Pragmatic Testing Strategy

Testing MUST be pragmatic—focus on risk areas and user value, not arbitrary coverage targets.

**Rules:**
- **Contract tests**: Required for all public APIs and service boundaries
- **Integration tests**: Required for critical user journeys (high-risk paths)
- **Unit tests**: Required for complex business logic and algorithms
- **End-to-end tests**: Optional, only for high-value critical paths
- Tests MUST fail before implementation (red-green-refactor when using TDD)
- Test quality matters more than test quantity—each test must validate real requirements

**Rationale:** 100% coverage wastes resources testing trivial code. Focus testing effort where it provides maximum risk reduction and value validation.

### V. Incremental Delivery

Features MUST be designed and implemented as independently deployable increments that deliver user value.

**Rules:**
- Break features into prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3...)
- Each user story MUST be independently testable and deliverable
- Deliver P1 story as MVP before starting P2
- Stop and validate after each story increment
- Avoid dependencies between user stories—each should stand alone

**Rationale:** Incremental delivery enables early feedback, reduces risk, allows course correction, and ensures partial value delivery even if later priorities are deferred.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- Follow consistent code formatting (use automated formatters)
- Write self-documenting code—clear names, logical structure
- Add comments only for "why", not "what"
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Maintain low cyclomatic complexity

### Documentation

- README MUST explain project purpose and quick start
- API contracts MUST be documented (see contracts/ in spec structure)
- Complex algorithms MUST have explanation comments
- Architecture decisions MUST be documented in plan.md or ADRs
- Update documentation in same PR as code changes

### Version Control

- Commit messages MUST be clear and descriptive
- Each commit SHOULD represent a logical unit of work
- Branch from main for each feature
- Use pull requests for all changes
- Keep commits atomic and reversible

## Review & Quality Gates

### Pre-Implementation Gates

Before coding begins:
- [ ] User stories defined with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Specification reviewed and approved (spec.md)
- [ ] Technical approach documented (plan.md)
- [ ] Complexity justified if deviating from simplicity principle
- [ ] Test strategy defined (which tests, why)

### Implementation Gates

Before marking work complete:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Required tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed by peer
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No unresolved TODOs or technical debt introduced without tracking

### Pre-Deployment Gates

Before releasing:
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance acceptable per defined criteria
- [ ] Security review completed for sensitive changes
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] User validation completed (if applicable)

## Governance

### Authority

This constitution supersedes all other project practices and guidelines. In case of conflict between this constitution and other documentation, the constitution takes precedence.

### Amendments

Constitution changes require:
1. Documented rationale for the change
2. Review of impact on existing templates and processes
3. Approval by project lead or designated authority
4. Version increment following semantic versioning
5. Update of all dependent templates and documentation

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes to core principles or removal of principles
- **MINOR** (1.x.0): Addition of new principles or substantial expansion of guidance
- **PATCH** (1.0.x): Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic fixes

### Compliance

- All code reviews MUST verify adherence to constitutional principles
- Violations require explicit justification and approval
- Repeated violations trigger process improvement review
- Constitution compliance is checked in plan template "Constitution Check" section

### Continuous Improvement

- Constitution is a living document
- Principles should evolve based on project learnings
- Regular retrospectives should evaluate principle effectiveness
- Updates should be timely but deliberate

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-23 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-23
